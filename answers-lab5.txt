1) The purpose of MPBOOTPHYS is so that we can translate the virtual address
of MPENTRY_PADDR into a physical address that is reachable by our application 
processors in real mode so that it can be executed. This is needed becauase
MPENTRY_PADDR is linked at a location that is too high for our 16 bit
processors to run.

2) We need a separate kernel stack for each CPU, because the big kernel lock
does not prevent another process from running and calling a trap. A scenario
in which using a shared kernel would go wrong (even with the big kernel lock)
is if we had an interrupt occur in the middle of a trap. This could cause the
orignal environment in the kernel stack to be overwritten by the one from the
interrupt. So, once the interrupt finishes we no longer have any information
about the previous trapframe.

3) Each environment's page directory is virutal address mapped above
Kernbase. This means that it does no matter which page directroy the mmu is
using for conversions, as the mapping of logical addresses to physical
addresses is the same across all page directories for that region.

4) The saving of the old environment's registers occurs in the trap call in
trap.c, with the line: 
	tf = &curenv->env_tf; 
This occurs so that we can correctly return back into user mode/that
environment when we complete the trap call.
