Questions:
3) The kernel will check to see if the user can actually call the exception
directly. If the DPL for the exception is 3, then the user is allowed to call
it direclty; if it's 0, then the user isn't, and the kernel will instead
default to a general protection fault. In this case, we want to set things up
such that the user can directly call a breakpoint exception, so in this case
we want to set the DPL to 3.
4) We want the user to only be able to call certain traps. This gives us
better control over how the user is and is not able to interact with the
kernel. There are certain dedicated entry points through which the user can
enter, and this helps us control the circumstances that lead to each entry
point.
