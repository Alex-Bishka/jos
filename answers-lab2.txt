Question 1 - 
We know that value is a pointer to a char, and that it can be dereferenced and
assigned a value. Therefore, value must be a virtual address. Therefore, it
makes the most sense to cast that pointer to a virtual address.

Question 2 - 
The top 16th of the entires have been filled in. The highest base virtual
address of these is 2^32 - 1 (0xffffffff) and the lowest is 0xf0000000. Each virtual address maps to 4MB of physical
memory, this maps to the first 256 MB in physical memory, starting from 0. The
rest of the table has been zeroed out. 

Question 3 -
User programs can not read or write to the kern;'s memory because of
protection bits. User programs can only access entries with the user bit.

Question 4 -
The maximum amount of physial memory this operating system can support is 256
MB because that is how much space the kernel has for physical memory.

Question 5 -
The overhead that would deal with physical memory mainly comes from the pages
array, the page directory table and the page table. The page directory and the
page table are each 4 KB (2^10 entires, each entry is 4 bytes).

Question 6 -
We transition after we jump into the kernel. The point of this is to map the
low 4 MB of virtual address to the low 4 MB of physical address.
