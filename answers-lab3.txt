Questions:
1.
The purpose of having an individual handler for each one is so that each
exception can have its own behavior. Specifically, we can have assembly that
pushes a different error number onto the stack depending on what error
occurred. If we only had one handler, then we wouldn't be able to figure out
what the original exception was for.

2.
We get interrupt vector 13 because the user was trying to executre a protected
instruction, so instead of a page fault, we get a general protection fault.
