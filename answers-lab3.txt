Questions:
1.
The purpose of having an individual handler for each one is so that each
exception can have its own behavior. Specifically, we can have assembly that
pushes a different error number onto the stack depending on what error
occurred. If we only had one handler, then we wouldn't be able to figure out
what the original exception was for.

2.
We get interrupt vector 13 because the user was trying to execute a protected
instruction, so instead of a page fault, we get a general protection fault.
This is because the DPL for trap 14 is zero, which means that the user can't 
access trap 14 directly, and instead is routed to trap 13. If we had specified 
that trap 14 was a DPL of three, then the user could have called trap 14
directly.
