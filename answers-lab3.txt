Questions:
1.
The purpose of having an individual handler for each one is so that each
exception can have its own behavior. Specifically, we can have assembly that
pushes a different error number onto the stack depending on what error
occurred. If we only had one handler, then we wouldn't be able to figure out
what the original exception was for.

2.
Nope! It worked perfectly on our first try. (we'll come back to this after we
clean up some stuff in trap.c).
