Questions:

1) If the transmit ring was not full, then we grab the packet from the user's
buffer and return 0. If the transmit ring is rull, then we just return -1, so
that the user knows to try again.

2) If the receive queue is empty and a user environment requests a packet, we
turn them away with a -1 again.

3) It says "This file came from JOS", with a marquee saying "Cheesy web page!"

4) It took about 12 hours maybe? We're also not done yet lol.
